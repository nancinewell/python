# Overview

A few months ago, I had the privilege to interview some developers who each followed different paths. Almost all of them suggeested that I learn Python if development is something I want to pursue. After several hours of study, this is my first Python project to get my feet wet. I plan to expand and continue Python over the next several weeks to get better at it. 

Embarking on this task, I set down an idea of a program that I wanted to make, but wasn't sure on the outset if I would focus on visual interface or not, so I made sure my idea could work in the console or with a GUI. This is a simple quiz that will tell the user what type of character they should be in our homeschool game. 

We gamify our school around here, and have characters that level up and gain skills based on what the kids do in school. This little quiz is to help them decide what class they might want their character to be based on their answers. The kids have a tendancy to have a hard time deciding, so this is meant to streamline that process. They don't have to be what the quiz tells them they're suited for, but by answering the questions, they'll get an idea of what they want so they won't be stuck in indecision.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
I wrote this program in the IDE Visual Studio Code version 1.105.1 with 4 extensions to make it more friendly to Python: Pylance, Python, Python Debugger, and Python Environments. 

I wrote this program using Python with Tkinter

# Future Work
- I would love to incorporate a database to store all the students who fill out the quiz.
- It would be a great improvement to move into a web app instead of TKinter. Tkinter was useful, but not customizable enough. Despite a lot of research, I just couldn't find ways to make the GUI look the way I wanted. 
- It would be very nice to incorporate images so the students could choose an avatar to represent their character.

# AI Usage
I wish I could claim to be as creative as those I admire, but alas, I'm not. The quiz questions themselves came from Copilot using the following prompts: 

- Can you build me a quick 5 question quiz to determine which character class a player should be amongst the options of healer, mage, and warrior. Give me the questions, possible answers, and results rubric so I can administer this little quiz to whomever I want. Make it kid friendly.
- Great- give me 5 more please
